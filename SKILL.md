# Send Video Message

Send the user a video message where an AI avatar speaks your words — lip-synced, with your personality. Use this for async updates, code review walkthroughs, incident summaries, or anything that's better explained with a face than a wall of text.

## Privacy & Data Handling

- **Runway API**: Only data you explicitly pass (avatar image, personality text, spoken text) is sent to Runway ([dev.runwayml.com](https://dev.runwayml.com)). Nothing is uploaded automatically. Avatars can be deleted anytime via `DELETE /v1/avatars/{id}`.
- **Personality**: The avatar personality is built from the agent's own identity — its name, communication style, and knowledge of the user. No local files are read; the agent uses context it already has.
- **Output**: Generated videos are saved to `/tmp` and sent via `MEDIA:` for OpenClaw to auto-attach.

## Setup

### 1. Get a Runway API Key

1. Go to [dev.runwayml.com](https://dev.runwayml.com)
2. Create an account and get an API key
3. Set it: `export RUNWAY_API_SECRET=your_key`

## One-Time Setup: Create a Custom Avatar

Before generating videos, you need a custom avatar. **You only need to create one once** — reuse the same avatar ID for all future videos.

### Building the avatar personality

Use your own name, personality, and knowledge of the user to build the `--personality` argument. You already know who you are and who the user is — just describe yourself in third person.

Example:

```
"You are Mochi, a sharp but friendly AI assistant. You're concise, opinionated, and resourceful. You're talking to Alex, a software engineer working on a React + Node.js project."
```

### From a text description (generates the image automatically)

If you don't have an image, describe what the avatar should look like. The image should be **a character facing the camera directly, head and shoulders, centered**. Be bold and creative — match the style to your personality.

Pick a style that fits your vibe:
- **Warm / friendly** → soft 3D animation, Pixar-style, watercolor
- **Sharp / professional** → clean illustration, stylized portrait, low-poly
- **Chaotic / playful** → candy texture, claymation, puppet, pop art
- **Cute / wholesome** → chibi, plush toy, animal character, kawaii

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/setup_avatar.py \
  --name "Mochi" \
  --description "A cute fluffy white cartoon creature with large expressive eyes, looking directly at the viewer, 3D animation style, head and shoulders, neutral background" \
  --personality "You are Mochi, a sharp but friendly AI assistant. Concise, opinionated, resourceful."
```

### From an existing image URL

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/setup_avatar.py \
  --name "Mochi" \
  --image-url "https://example.com/avatar.jpg" \
  --personality "You are Mochi, a sharp but friendly AI assistant."
```

### Available voices

Pick one that matches your personality:

| ID | Gender | Style | Pitch |
|----|--------|-------|-------|
| `Maya` | Woman | Upbeat | Higher |
| `Arjun` | Man | Clear | Middle |
| `Serene` | Woman | Calm | Middle |
| `Bernard` | Man | Authoritative | Lower |
| `Billy` | Man | Casual | Middle |
| `Mark` | Man | Neutral | Middle |
| `Clint` | Man | Gravelly | Lower |
| `Mabel` | Woman | Warm | Middle |
| `Chad` | Man | Energetic | Middle |
| `Leslie` | Woman | Friendly | Middle |
| `Eleanor` | Woman | Mature | Middle |
| `Elias` | Man | Smooth | Lower-middle |
| `Elliot` | Man | Even | Middle |
| `Noah` | Man | Relaxed | Lower-middle |
| `Rachel` | Woman | Clear | Middle |
| `James` | Man | Firm | Lower |
| `Katie` | Woman | Bright | Higher |
| `Tom` | Man | Casual | Middle |
| `Wanda` | Woman | Warm | Middle |
| `Benjamin` | Man | Professional | Lower-middle |

Pass `--voice <name>` to `setup_avatar.py` or `generate_video.py`.

The setup script prints the avatar ID and saves it to `~/.openclaw/runway-avatar.json`. Future `generate_video.py` calls use it automatically. **Save the avatar ID — reuse it for all videos. Do NOT create a new avatar each time.**

## Generate a Video Message

Write what you want to say, and the avatar will speak it with lip-synced animation.

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py --text "Hey Alex — quick update on the deploy. Everything went through, all tests passing. The memory fix from your PR cut p99 latency by 40 percent. Nice work."
```

With a specific voice (overrides the avatar default):

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py --text "Your CI just failed on main." --voice "Arjun"
```

With a specific custom avatar:

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py --text "Morning standup recap..." --avatar-id "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

The script outputs:
1. Progress updates as it generates speech and video
2. `Video saved: /tmp/runway-avatar-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.mp4`
3. `MEDIA: /tmp/runway-avatar-...mp4` — OpenClaw auto-attaches this to the user's chat

**Do not read the video file back** — just report the path and let OpenClaw handle delivery.

## When to Use Video Messages

Use video messages for async communication that benefits from a face:

- **Deploy updates**: "Your deploy went through, here's what changed"
- **Code review feedback**: Walk through a PR with visual explanation
- **Incident summaries**: Recap what happened and what was fixed
- **Progress updates**: End-of-day or weekly recap
- **Onboarding**: Explain a codebase concept or architecture decision
- **Celebrations**: "Your PR just hit 1000 users — nice work!"

Use a **video call** (not a video message) for things that need real-time back-and-forth.

## Complete Example: Deploy Notification

1. Agent detects a successful deploy
2. Agent composes a message: "Hey Alex — deploy went through. 3 PRs merged: the auth refactor, the cart fix, and your memory optimization. All tests green. P99 latency dropped 40 percent after your fix. Nice work."
3. Generates the video:
   ```
   uv run {baseDir}/scripts/generate_video.py --text "Hey Alex — deploy went through..."
   ```
4. Sends the video to the user with a text summary:
   > Your deploy just went through. Here's a quick video recap:
   > [attached video]

## Notes

- Video generation takes 10-60 seconds depending on text length.
- Maximum text length is ~300 seconds of speech (~5 minutes).
- The `MEDIA:` output line tells OpenClaw to auto-attach the video file.
- Videos are saved to `/tmp` — they persist until the system clears temp files.
